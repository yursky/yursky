I'm an engineer currently living in 🌁 San Francisco, CA. I write a lot of js and go. Right now, I'm helping build an early stage startup. Before that, I used to work on [this](https://www.workday.com/en-us/products/platform-product-extensions/application-development.html), a platform for people to build custom applications on top of workday.
